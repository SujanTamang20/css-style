                <h3>Mercury</h3>
                <p></p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in the solar system.
                It has no atmosphere and is covered with craters due to impacts from asteroids and comets.
                Its surface experiences extreme temperature variations, ranging from extremely hot during the day to very cold at night.

                <h3>Venus</h3>
                <p>Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" because of its similar size and composition.
                    It has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, which traps heat and leads to a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in the solar system.
                    Venus is shrouded in thick clouds of sulfuric acid, which obscure its surface from view.</p>

                <h3>Earth</h3>
                <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life.
                    It has a diverse and dynamic environment with vast oceans, continents, and a protective atmosphere that sustains various forms of life.
                    Earth is the only planet where water exists in all three states: solid (ice), liquid (oceans), and gas (water vapor).</p>

                <h3>Mars</h3>
                <p>Mars, also known as the "Red Planet," gets its reddish appearance from iron oxide (rust) on its surface.
                    It has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris.
                    Mars has polar ice caps and evidence of ancient rivers, suggesting that liquid water once flowed on its surface.Mars is known as the Red Planet because of its reddish appearance...</p>

            <h2>The Outer Planets</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Jupiter</h3>
                <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, with a diameter more than 11 times that of Earth.
                    It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium and has a dense atmosphere with colorful bands and a Great Red Spot, a giant storm system.
                    Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and a large number of moons, including the four largest called the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Saturn</h3>
                <p>Saturn is famous for its spectacular ring system, which is composed of ice particles, rocks, and dust.
                    It is the second-largest planet and has a similar composition to Jupiter, primarily consisting of hydrogen and helium.
                    Saturn has many moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the solar system, which has a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane on its surface.</p>

                <h3>Uranus</h3>
                <p>Uranus is an ice giant planet with a bluish-green color due to methane in its atmosphere.
It is unique among the planets because it rotates on its side, possibly due to a collision early in its history.
Uranus has a system of rings and a diverse collection of moons, including Miranda, which has unusual surface features such as cliffs and valleys.</p>

                <h3>Neptune</h3>
                <p>Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun and the fourth-largest by diameter.
                    It has a deep blue coloration, attributed to the presence of methane in its atmosphere.
                    Neptune has strong winds and the fastest winds recorded in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour.
                    It has a system of rings and a collection of moons, including Triton, which orbits in the opposite direction to Neptune's rotation and is likely a captured Kuiper Belt object.</p>
